## Introduction

Our project TeamUp is a multidisciplinary online collaboration platform for uni students (especially students doing Computer Science or Interaction Design). TeamUp is more lightweight than any other platforms, which is easier for students to learn. The Kanban and the Drive is highly connected, changes in the Drive will be displayed on Kanban automatically, the interaction is streamlined and simple, users can do split screen within our web pages to avoid swiping between many tabs. It can also tell users other teammates’ local time, so users can manage their schedule easier for cross-regional collaboration.

This is the [Link to our Proof of Concept Prototype](https://github.com/realDona1dTrump/PSG.LGD/blob/main/pages/kanban.html.md). User needs to enter “Jim” for the username, and can enter anything for the password.

This is our [Miro Link](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lz9jLgs=/?invite_link_id=921271592583). In the early stage of product conception, we used Miro for wireframing and shared important content such as questionnaires, collected data, and our discussion results.

This is our [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/FZD6PdI99MoQNfOJ8uXydH/DECO3500-MedFi-Prototype-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1), we have finished our functional and aesthetic design on Figma, and completed our Proof of Concept Prototype based on this.

This is our [Promotional Video link](https://youtu.be/TmvrwKlb3us). This video roughly introduces the functions and features of TeamUp.
